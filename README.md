## Special Thanks

 * [Brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/), whose slick UI I <del>ripped off</del> paid homage to wholeheartedly, and with much love.
 * Ondřej Žára, whose Javascript roguelike [The Royal Wedding](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/games/trw/) inspired me to use his [rot.js](http://ondras.github.com/rot.js/) library. rot.js turned out to be a tremendous boon, and I'd recommend it to anyone trying to get started making a roguelike.
 * [\#rgrd](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Chat_room), for providing some much-needed procrastination fodder.
 * Orson Welles.
